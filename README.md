### General

This project consists of feature tests for main .NET dependency injection framework/libraries.  
It is a follow-up to my old posts on the matter.

Main information will be available on [wiki](../../wiki) (when/if I find time for it).

### Projects

  1. FeatureTests: xUnit feature tests.
  2. TableGenerator: helper project that is used to generate [html tables](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ashmind/net-di-frameworks/blob/master/%23generated/FeatureTests.html).
