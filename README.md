### Overview

This project consists of feature tests for main .NET dependency injection framework/libraries.  
It is a follow-up to my old posts on the matter.

### Approach

All documentation/comparison tables are currently generated automatically (based on source code annotations).  
You can see latest version here: [Feature Tests](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/ashmind/net-di-frameworks/blob/master/%23generated/FeatureTests.html)
(it is using GitHub htmlpreview 'hack', so please wait for styles to load or refresh if there are problems).


### Projects

  1. FeatureTests: xUnit feature tests.
  2. TableGenerator: helper project that is used to generate documentation.  
     Build and run TableGenerator after any changes to the tests.
